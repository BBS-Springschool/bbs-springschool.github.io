  description: Research Data Management (RDM) is key to ensure FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data. This will help to make your research reproducible and to ensure high quality results. In this session, we'll cover all topics around the data lifecycle to see where a researcher needs to think about RDM and we'll present tools that can be used for RDM.

  description: Contrary to a common believe, design is not only about making things pretty. However, design is supposed to be functional (with beauty being a side effect). Let's explore what's the difference between design and decoration and how we can use fonts, colours and current design trends to our advantage.

- title: "Flexible behavior under uncertainty in autism spectrum disorders through the lens of simple reinforcement learning models"
  id: lzhang
  image: LeiZhang.jpg
  description: One of the core symptoms of autism is repetitive behavior, which is likely to be underpinned by cognitive inflexibility, i.e., the deficit in responding to changes in the environment. I will showcase how to measure flexible behavior with a probabilistic learning task, and how to quantify the suboptimal learning in autism using simple reinforcement learning models, under the hierarchical Bayesian analysis framework.

- title: "Getting to know Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS): A Hands-on Tutorial"
  id: tkanatschnig
  image: tkanatschnig.jpg
  description: In this 60-90 min demonstration, the goal is to give interested participants a basic introduction to the acquisition and analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data. A short presentation about the methodological principles of fNIRS is followed by a live data acquisition session and subsequent inspection of the data with the open-source analysis software “HOMER” [https://openfnirs.org](https://openfnirs.org/){:target="_blank"}. 
  authors: Thomas Kanatschnig
  about: Thomas Kanatschnig studied psychology at the University of Graz and graduated in January 2021. The topic of his master’s thesis contained the evaluation of sensorimotor activation patterns during basketball dribbling and its effects on creative ability with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Since March 2021 he is a university assistant at the department of Neuropsychology & Neuroimaging of the University of Graz. Since October 2021 he is also a PhD-student at the COLIBRI section of the University of Graz.
