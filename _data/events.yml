  description: Research Data Management (RDM) is key to ensure FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data. This will help to make your research reproducible and to ensure high quality results. In this session, we'll cover all topics around the data lifecycle to see where a researcher needs to think about RDM and we'll present tools that can be used for RDM.

  id: lzhang
  image: LeiZhang.jpg
  description: One of the core symptoms of autism is repetitive behavior, which is likely to be underpinned by cognitive inflexibility, i.e., the deficit in responding to changes in the environment. I will showcase how to measure flexible behavior with a probabilistic learning task, and how to quantify the suboptimal learning in autism using simple reinforcement learning models, under the hierarchical Bayesian analysis framework.
