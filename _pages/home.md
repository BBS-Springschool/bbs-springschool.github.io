Following the tradition of open science and joint workshops, we want to revive the the concept of *Springschools*, combine it with the spirit of *[Brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/)* and open it to all interested students to bridge all scientific disciplines. This school aims at combining ideas of a traditional hackathon with educational elements and dedicated thematic talks. 

As such, we plan to combine open-hacking and unconference sessions with a learning track intermixed with featured talks unter the umbrella of a general topic: **“CHANGE: How to measure, detect, and quantify change reliably.”** This topic is inspired by the CoVID-pandemic that consistently changed the world, science, and society. Therefore, all featured talks will be given by invited speakers to enlighten the global theme of **“Change”** either from the perspective of the *brain*, or from the point of view of *behaviour*, or from a *social* point of view. 

With this 2022 edition of the **“Brain / Behaviour / Society Spring School”** we hope to settle the starting point for a possible future series of variant themes and topics. 

We are grateful for the support and funding from the [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at), the [Complexity of LIfe in Basic Research and Innovation (COLIBRI)](https://colibri.uni-graz.at/en/) and the [NeuroImaging-Lab Graz](https://neuroimaging.uni-graz.at)
