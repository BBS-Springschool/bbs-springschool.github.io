Welcome to the first edition of the **“Brain / Behaviour / Society Springschool”** in Graz. Following the tradition of open science and joint workshops, we want to combine the the concept of a standard *Springschools*, with the spirit of *[Brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/)* and open it to all interested students within the field of neuroscience, cognitive science, biology, psychology and social sciences to name only few.
