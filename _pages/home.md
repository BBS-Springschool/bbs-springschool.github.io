Welcome to the first edition of the **“Brain / Behaviour / Society Springschool”** in Graz. Following the tradition of open science and joint workshops, we want to combine the the concept of a standard *Springschools* with the spirit of *[Brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/)* and open it to everybody interested in behavior within the fields of medicine, cognitive science, biology, psychology, behavioral and social sciences to name only few. 

As such, this *springschool* will be a 4 day event that combines open-hacking and unconference sessions with learning tracks all intermixed with featured talks under the umbrella of one general topic

<center>
<H4>“CHANGE: How to measure, detect, and quantify change reliably.”</H4>
</center> 

This topic is inspired by the CoVID-pandemic that consistently changed the world, science, and society. Therefore, all projects and featured talks will be given by invited speakers to enlighten the global theme of “Change” either from the perspective of the brain, or from the point of view of behavior, or from a social point of view. In summary, this 2022 edition of the “Brain / Behavior / Society Springschool” should represent the starting point of a long lasting series with variant themes and topics in the future.

General directions to the University of Graz can be found [here](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/contact-and-arriving/).
### CoVID-19 Safety 

Due to the still ongoing CoVID-pandemic we have to restrict the number of participants on site. Therefore, also due to the current CoVID-19 regulations at the [Unicorn Graz](https://unicorn-graz.at/) and the [University of Graz](https://uni-graz.at/) we have to ask everyone to register for the main event plus eventually for the different side events like talks, tutorials, lab-visits, or educationals. 

All on-site participants will need to fulfill the CoVID-19 regulations put forward by the Austrian government which are subject to change. Please see the CoVID-19 regulations by the [University of Graz](https://covid-19.uni-graz.at/en/) and the [Austrian Government](https://www.sozialministerium.at/en.html). Since we are well aware that not everyone will be able to join in person due to various causes, we will run the whole event in hybrid format.
