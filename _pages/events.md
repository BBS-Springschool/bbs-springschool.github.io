  <eventtitle id="mfuellsack">"Predicting Change in Integrated Information - on the example of Early Warning Signals in assortative spin-shifting networks"</eventtitle>
  <p>From a systems science perspective, there is reason to assume that abrupt perceptual changes - e.g. the sudden shift from seeing a black patch to seeing a white one - are caused by an integrated interaction of neurons, never by a mere aggregation of neurons in isolated activity. Therefore, to explore the possibilities for predicting such changes, one needs to consider social or network effects. The talk will present possibilities for such considerations, demonstrate statistical prediction methods and discuss some of their caveats.

  <eventtitle id="mninaus">"Understanding educational games: Multimodal investigations of cognitive and emotional factors when learning with games"</eventtitle>
  <p>Educational games have become a popular and effective approach for learning and can augment traditional instruction. However, the underlying mechanisms by which games engage learners and promote learning are still unclear. In the current talk, I will focus on the use of multimodal measures to investigate cognitive and emotional factors when learning with games.

  <eventtitle id="dalbert">"Behavioral Change from a Psychological Point of View"</eventtitle>
  <p>Starting from the fundamental questions of what the terms behavior and behavior change mean in psychology, we briefly go into how to model adaptive assessment of knowledge and competence. Then we will turn to the possibilities of technology-enhanced learning for improving knowledge and competences, and consider the relationship between knowledge and behavior. The question on how to reduce the knowledge-behavior gap is important. Finally, further psychological challenges and open questions will briefly be brought forward for discussion </p>
